This is meant to help you figure out the sources you should go look up. By all means, do your own digging - these are all primers to help you fish on your own. And all credit to transparent search URLs to LinkedIn, Google, Crunchbase, H1Bdata.info

<p>
<p><b>LinkedIn Search - Enter the name of the company you want to search for</b></p>

<form target="_blank" action="https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p">
	<input name="keywords">
	<input type="submit">
</form>
</p>
<br </br>
<p>
<p><b>Crunchbase Search - Enter the name of the company you want to search for</b></p>
</p>

<form target="_blank" action="https://www.crunchbase.com/app/search">
	<input name="q">
	<input type="submit">
</form>
<br </br>
<p> You should also be extremely concerned about any bad news that makes it to Google </p>

<p> Go ahead, type something like "Uber Layoffs" below</p>
<form target="_blank" action="https://www.google.com/">
	<input name="q">
	<input type="submit">
</form>
<br </br>
<p> You should also try out <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm"> Glassdoor Company Reviews </a> but beware, there is a ton to sift through there </p>

<p> Curious about salaries? </p>
<p> Try out this site. Its all government filings so you know the information is accurate the day it was filed. 
NB: Promotions are not really considered so the salary data is really a point in time estimate</p>
