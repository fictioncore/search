<p>
This is meant to help you figure out the sources you should go look up. By all means, do your own digging - these are all primers to help you fish on your own. And all credit to transparent search URLs to LinkedIn, Google, Crunchbase, H1Bdata.info
</p>

<p><b>LinkedIn</b> Search - Enter the name of the company you want to search for. By far the best place to get information about people in your network. And general information about what a company is up to. </p>

<form target="_blank" action="https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p">
	<input name="keywords">
	<input type="submit">
</form>

<p>
Even more information specifically for startups and smaller companies. With a little digging, you'll be able to know the rounds of funding, the creds that the founders have and any other data points for research. 
</p>
<p><b>Crunchbase</b> Search - Enter the name of the company you want to search for</p>

<form target="_blank" action="https://www.crunchbase.com/app/search">
	<input name="q">
	<input type="submit">
</form>

<p> You should also be extremely concerned about any bad news that makes it to <b>Google</b>. If its bad enough to make it to Google, you might want to do a little bit of digging and ask around. Don't willingly walk into a fiasco. It will never be worth it. </p>

<p> Go ahead, type something like "Uber Layoffs" below</p>
<form target="_blank" action="https://www.google.com/">
	<input name="q">
	<input type="submit">
</form>

<p> You should also try out <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm"> Glassdoor Company Reviews </a> but beware, there is a ton to sift through there. Typically if you are super unhappy, you will write an unhappy review. So don't let the reviews be the only source you consider. </p>

<p> And lastly, curious about salaries? You are lying if you say you aren't</p>
<p> Try out this site. Its all government filings so you know the information is accurate the day it was filed. 
NB: Promotions are not really considered so the salary data is really a point in time estimate</p>
